# Neuro-fuzzy-approach-based-COVID-19-model
This repository contains the simulation data for a Neuro-fuzzy inference system operating on inputs collected from medical histories of patients, and processes those inputs with a set of rules, to generate an output that be able to describe the degree of extent of Immune Response of that particular person.

Note: The MATLAB Simulation File is a .fis file and can only viewed and executed, using an appropriate version of MATLAB and its ANFIS library.
